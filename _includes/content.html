<dfn>Clinical Supervision & Consultation for Mental Health Professionals</dfn>

<p>I provide supervision and consultation services for clinicians and mental health professionals. My focus is on supporting fellow practitioners in their clinical work through psychodynamic supervision and professional consultation.</p>

<p>I have been in private practice since 1980 and am Board Certified in Psychiatry. My clinical experience includes decades of in-depth psychodynamic psychotherapy for a wide range of issues including depression and anxiety, integrating medication when appropriate to supplement talk therapy. I now dedicate my practice to sharing this expertise through supervision and consultation with fellow mental health professionals.</p>
